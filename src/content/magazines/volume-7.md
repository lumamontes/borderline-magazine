# Notes

Reading so many online pieces  can be overwhelming. We want to give the ones we publish a particular space to be perused and discussed in more depth. In doing so, we also hope to further our mission of amplifying young creative voices and facilitating creative discussions. Interviews with the contributors from a specific volume, starting from Volume V: inspirations, creative practices, experiences with publishing. And behind-the-scenes insights from the borderline's editorial team on how the volume was compiled and designed.
